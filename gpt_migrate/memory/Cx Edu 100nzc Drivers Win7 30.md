## Step 2: Extract and Install the Drivers
 
The next step is to extract and install the drivers that you have downloaded. If you have downloaded individual files, you can simply double-click on them and follow the on-screen instructions to install them. If you have downloaded a zip file, you need to extract it first using a tool like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
After extracting the zip file, you will see a folder containing several subfolders with different driver names. You need to open each subfolder and run the setup.exe file to install the driver. You may need to restart your laptop after installing some drivers for them to take effect.

One of the best driver updater tools that we recommend is Driver Easy. Driver Easy is a powerful and easy-to-use tool that can update all your drivers with just one click. It also has a free version that allows you to update up to two drivers per day.
