# How to Fix Xbox Xiso Manager 1.3.1 404 Error
 
If you are trying to download or extract XISO files for your Xbox games using Xbox Xiso Manager 1.3.1, you may encounter a 404 error that prevents you from completing the process. This error means that the server cannot find the requested file or resource. There are several possible reasons for this error, such as:
 
- The XISO file you are trying to download or extract is no longer available on the server.
- The URL you are using to access the XISO file is incorrect or outdated.
- The server is experiencing technical issues or maintenance.
- Your internet connection is unstable or slow.
- Your firewall or antivirus software is blocking the access to the XISO file.

1. Check the URL of the XISO file and make sure it is correct and up-to-date. You can use a web browser to test if the URL is working or not. If not, you may need to find another source for the XISO file.
2. Refresh the page or try again later. Sometimes, the server may be temporarily unavailable or overloaded. You can wait for a few minutes and retry the download or extraction process.
3. Check your internet connection and make sure it is stable and fast enough. You can use a speed test tool to measure your internet speed and ping. If your connection is slow or unstable, you may need to switch to a different network or contact your internet service provider.
4. Disable your firewall or antivirus software temporarily and see if that solves the problem. Some firewall or antivirus software may block the access to certain files or websites for security reasons. You can turn them off while downloading or extracting the XISO file and turn them back on afterwards.
5. Use a different tool or software to download or extract the XISO file. Xbox Xiso Manager 1.3.1 is not the only tool that can handle XISO files. You can try other alternatives, such as **extract-xiso**[^1^], **XisoManager**[^2^], or **Xbox Backup Creator**. These tools may have different features and compatibility with different XISO files.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you fix the Xbox Xiso Manager 1.3.1 404 error and enjoy your Xbox games.

XISO files are a type of ISO files that are used to store Xbox games on discs or hard drives. XISO files can be created from original Xbox discs or downloaded from the internet. XISO files can be useful for backing up your Xbox games, playing them on emulators, or modifying them with custom content.
 
However, XISO files are not compatible with most standard ISO tools or software. You need a special tool or software that can handle XISO files and perform various operations on them, such as creating, extracting, listing, or rewriting. One of these tools is Xbox Xiso Manager 1.3.1, which is a free and easy-to-use program that can manage XISO files on your computer.
